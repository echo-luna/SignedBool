## SignedBool ##
A SignedBoolean, AKA an Abstract Boolean, is a boolean value with four states best represented by adding simple signage to the boolean false.

+True
+False
-True
-False

This library applies the field of abstract boolean to C++ code to demosntrate feasibility and workability. Please verify the outputs, I have not built automated testing on these values yet.
